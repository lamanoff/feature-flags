## About this project

This is a system that allows you to manage feature flags, as well as consume them in your projects.


## What is feature-flags?

Feature flags are a software development technique that allows developers to change the behavior of a program without having to release a new version or make changes to the code. Feature flags allow you to enable or disable certain features, modify the application's configuration, or control the program's behavior in real time.

The main idea of feature flags is to have a point of control from which you can control various aspects of the application. This could be setting a flag to enable or disable certain functionality, setting various options, or changing the application's configuration.


## What is implemented now

- Web API, which is a CRUD application that allows you to work with feature flags on the server side.
